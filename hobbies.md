# Hobbies

## Traveling

<br>The unknowns and mysteries during the journey are as exciting to me as the constant exploration and discovery of the unknown in scientific research.



## Basketball

Playing basketball removes my worries, refreshes my body, and brings me courage to address any challenges. I extremely enjoy the feeling of being immersed in the basketball games. Besides, I am the starting guard of the basketball Team in class, where I meet many sincere friends. I once won fourth place in a college basketball game.

## Past Hobbies

I previously enjoyed long-distance running and computer game developing/playing. However, I have no time to do any of these things recently.

## My Dogs

They are all my love. The white one is Bai Xiao(小白), the other one is lucky(幸运).
