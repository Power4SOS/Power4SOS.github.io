# About Me

<img src="https://Power4SOS.github.io/JieDeng.jpg" class="floatpic" width="350" height="431">

Here is **Jie Deng (邓杰)**.

I am studying towards a master degree and majoring in **Power electronics** at Hebei University of science. My research interests mainly include the modulation and control of high switching frequency and high power density three-phase inverters, advised by [Prof. Jianliang Chen](https://ee.hebut.edu.cn/szdw/jsml/C/22f560b1df664d6eb9f01094159c11f2.html). Here is [[my CV](https://Power4SOS/file/CV-JieDeng.pdf)].

## Research Interests

- High switching frequency/high power density three-phase inverters
- Model of variable switching frequency converters
- Noninvasive technique for DC-link capacitance estimation
- Machine learning

My current research focuses on practical problems that miniaturization of power electronic devices face in real life. My interests are on the **Variable switching frequency control** and its applications in **Three-phase inverters**. In a word, advanced technologies like variable  switching frequency control and machine learning positively influence the life of everybody.  I wish to devote my talent to this meaningful cause and bring well-being to society.
